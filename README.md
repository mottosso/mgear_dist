### mGear: Rigging framework for Autodesk Maya

End-user distribution of mgear.

<br>

mgear consists of many parts, developed independently. Some of these parts fit together at particular versions, this repository maintains a collection of versions that are compatible with each other.

- See [**Releases**](../releases) for a ready-to-use distribution of mgear.

The general rule is; each individual repository MUST be usable standalone (in conjuntion with core) to facilitate independent development of each part in isolation from each other. This repository is then an *additional* method with which to distribute and consume mgear, primarily intended for the end-user who *does not* want to contribute back to the project through GitHub.
<br>

mGear is a rigging framework for Autodesk Maya. mGear provides a set of convenient modules, tools and c++ solvers to streamline the development of rigging and animation tools.

Originally mGear was design and develope by Jeremie Passerin and Miquel Campos. Currently  mGear is maintained by the mgear-dev organization team.
